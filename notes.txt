2/25

before:
- today I need to make sense of these topics -- pick good topics to choose
- if i get a good number of topics, I move to writing the paper itself

after:
- I decided to add not just the titles but also the text of the posts -- I think it makes more sense to include more information
- I now need to label these topics now that the text has been expanded

3/19

general:
- I need to work on this more

before:
- going to be working on labeling all of the text today

after:
- ended up just doing some more text cleaning
