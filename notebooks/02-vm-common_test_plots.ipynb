      "s to be 'too startup-y' my student health insurance was through aetna which i'm sure has tons of options as well are there any other big ones i should be looking at any companies that specialize in graduates (healthy working-age people) for better deals for example\n\ni'm not trying to pay $1000 per month for a small deductible but i'm also not trying to pay $50 per month for a $10000 deductible \n\nany help will be greatly appreciated \ncheers hi all \n\nmy wife and i are going to start the ivf  process for a baby we are on her work insurance she works for a company that has 30 employees or so however our existing health insurance does not cover ivf ( they cover the $2000-$8000 in drugs but not the $16k procedure)\n \napparently she only has access to 2 potential plans at work and her other plan also doesn't cover ivf \n\ni work as a 1099 consultant so i am on her insurance \n\nwe would like to start ivf in about 1 month \n\nany suggestions on how we can find a health insurance that will cover ivf in this situation / with these parameters \n\nthanks   i am currently covered under medi-cal i live in california but they don't do much in the way of dental i have visited the dentists that accept my insurance and they are basically just butchers with very dirty offices my boyfriend has the same insurance he has particularly bad teeth and when he went in for a consultation the dentist just assumed he was some kind of meth addict and laughed at him\n\nanyway my parents retired from the air force a few years ago i've been on my own since i was 18 and so have not been covered under their tricare \n\ni recently heard that adults under 25 still qualify for their parent's coverage- i'm 24 is it possible for me to use their tricare still  i spent couple hours on researching how the health care works in usa and i have a vague idea of how much i will need to spend on health insurance and what kind of plans i want now the only thing needed is to decide on the health insurance provider that's where it really gets tricky\n\ni looked for any reviews of the insurers and everybody just hates every single one of them there's no positive reviews whatsoever that gives me a pretty decent picture of the situation but on the other hand people tend to mostly post reviews if they have a complaint to make\n\ndo you have your favorite insurance company maybe you changed plans or switched insurers recently and you're more/less happy with your current one \n\ni will appreciate any links or suggestions - this is pretty new to me recently moved to tn from the state of tx and i qualify for a special enrollment period from aca's website \n\nlooking through the plans i noticed all of them are ppo plans when i signed up in the state of tx there were a variety hmos ppos etc \n\nis there an explanation as to why this is i've googled it but no answers come up just curious why the different states vary in coverage options \n\nthanks while there isn’t a guaranteed way to prevent scaffolding accidents from occurring you can make sure that you and your employees are properly trained and protected in case these types of accidents occur don’t leave your company at risk and contact the largest insurance broker of scaffold risks in the country at allied insurance brokers\n hello i am starting a new job in 2 weeks the company covers 100% of the monthly insurance premiums for me however to add my wife and 2 children the cost would be over $1000 per month which is not what i would consider to be reasonable do i have an alternative can i get private insurance thank you  hi all \n\ni'm trying to figure out the best answer to a quandary that dear hubby and i are up against \n\nhubby has been an employee of the small llc that he and i own (taking a regular salaried paycheck at $35k annually) since march \n\ni am a contract worker pulling in about $30k annually (maybe more maybe less; it all depends) \n\nwe were planning on getting health insurance through the small business through the exchange when our medicaid expired (which could literally be any day now) \n\nhowever because the business had less than one employee last year we're not able to get the business to pay for insurance through the health exchange officially can the business still pay for our personal premiums and get the tax benefits \n\nwe're both 28 reasonably healthy thinking about starting the baby making process in the next year or so \n\nwhat's the best move here \n\n\n\n we just received about $500 worth of co-pay refund checks in the mail from services that my wife received last year they are from the provider not the insurance company\n\nwhen we called the provider they said that the health insurance company deemed these services as not needing a copay and so we were refunded but when i called the health insurance company they have no information regarding an overpayment on our part or a request that we be refunded for any of the service dates\n\nkind of at a loss here the money would certainly be helpful and i'll even stick it in a savings account for a month or two just in case but i know there's no such thing as a free lunch these were sick visits at a specialist and we paid the copay required by our plan \n\nany thoughts\n\n**edit**: the only thing we can think of is that they rolled these services into pre-natal care since my wife had to go to this specialist after discovering she had complications with the pregnancy but this was a gi specialist so it still doesn't seem right hey guys\n\nmy company is trying to investigate the new dna stool sample test cologuard we're trying to figure out how much these insurance companies are paying out for each test for commercial patients the following insurance companies we're looking for:\n\n* anthem blue cross and blue shield:\n* tufts health plan:\n* carefirst bluecross blueshield ppo (carefirst):\n* excellus bcbs wny:\n* dean health plan:\n\ncan anyone here lookup g0464 and the payout for the above listed insurance companies  hi \n\nlong story short i cant run or do any type of heavy weight lifting because the bottom of my feet cramp right away i have united healthcare ppo plus as my insurance anyways  i went to see my primary provider and he could not find anything wrong with me he suggested i go see a foot doctor i looked up a foot doctor within my network and went there he could not find anything wrong but he suggested custom orthopedic inserts for my feet i just got them and i found out that they are not covered by plan it is a $1000+ bill for custom made inserts is there anyway i can get my insurance to pay for them can i argue that the issue with my feet has caused me to stop physical activities i am completely ignorant when it comes to health insurance \n\nplease let me know\n\nthanks for reading  they sent us this huge packet explaining the benefits but i feel so ignorant reading through everything\n\ni was hoping to find someone who can explain what this stuff means and yes i already called the company and talked to someone there but i guess i wasn't phrasing my questions clearly because i was more lost after talking with them than i was before hi all thanks for helping by clicking in \nmy questions : would i still be qualify for medicaid even though i have $xxxxx (x-es as digits) in my bank account but no income  \nwould i be better off just apply a health insurance from the healthinsurancemarketplace\nare there better options \nthanks again and have a good one  i was on my dad's health insurance until a year before i graduated college it's been almost three years now i think since i've been uninsured haven't gotten a physical or seen a doctor at all in that time because i'm young and invincible and stupid as hell\n\ni make about 70k/year but dealing with insurance is something i've never been taught how to do at this point i just want to sign up for whatever because i really want to get a physical and find out which cancers are brewing inside me\n\ni guess i'm just looking for advice what should any first time buyer know\n\nmy biggest question is what happens if i get diagnosed with a serious medical condition and i'm on the cheapest insurance can i just game the system and upgrade to something that will cover all my costs or do i have to do that before a diagnosis or is there a certain amount of time i have to wait on any health insurance plan before it kicks in\n\nsorry for being retarded i'll get it checked out once i get some insurance in the meantime help please and thank you :) i an a relatively new construction business i have 4 employees including myself none of us have health insurance i'm looking into the benefits of providing insurance through my company (more specifically paying about 50% of the premiums)\n\ni've glanced around at options through united health but really don't know anything about what i'm looking for\n\nany literature in the matter\nhow do i know the program qualifies i'd the aca minimums\nwhat is a __% coinsurance\n\nanything else i should be weary about do i qualify for cobra if my employer failed to pay the premium to our health insurance last november my boyfriend had some blood work done we paid a co-pay at the office and a little over a month received a small bill from the lab around $58 no problem\n\n\ntoday may 12th we get a bill from the lab for $1200+ telling us it's due on the 15th i logged into his insurance provider's website and his claim history lists the entire $1700 cost of the blood work as \"paid\" and the \"amount you may owe\" is listed as $0 the date on that was 01/02/2015\n\n\nthe bill lists:\n\n11/25/15 - total billed : $1700\n\n01/26/15 - payment applied : $58 (the amount we paid)\n\n01/26/15 - contractual insurance adjustment : $447\n\n\nbut when i log on to blue cross:\n\n01/02/15 - $1700 total paid in full according to insurance provider\n\n\ncan anyone point me in the direction of who i should be contacting to sort this out does it benefit the hospital/clinic more than the patient to do global maternity billing (aka billing everything at the end) instead of billing for services as they're rendered \n\ni feel like it would be more beneficial to know what i'm paying at that moment rather than be shocked by a bill afterwards plus prenatal and postnatal doc visits are covered by the healthcare act so i'd like to know that visit i have is free\n\nthe clinic i had planned on going to wants to charge everything at a family deductible even though most of the care is for me at my individual plan\n\ndoes anyone know about how global maternity billing works  i have an individual health plan through work and am currently 105 weeks pregnant the birth center i decided on just gave me a breakdown of their total cost of care \n\nthey want to charge me a total of almost 13k pre-insurance for everything--prenatal labor delivery and some newborn care \n\nmy current plan has a $1500 deductible then services at 70/30 (30% my cost) and a $5500 max it of pocket\n\ni noticed that the birth center has me at the family deductible of $4500 even though about 75% of the fees are for my care prenatal the other $25% will be baby fees post natal they reasoned it was because they charge all this at the end when the baby is already born\n\ndoes this seem ok to you this is my first pregnancy and i have no idea how much it costs to have a baby \n\ni thought birth centers were a lot cheaper than hospitals should i look elsewhere i live in minneapolis just in case this helps  hey guys\n\nmy company is trying to investigate the new dna stool sample test cologuard we're trying to figure out how much these insurance companies are paying out for each test for commercial patients the following insurance companies we're looking for:\n\n* anthem blue cross and blue shield: \n\n* tufts health plan: \n\n* carefirst bluecross blueshield ppo (carefirst):\n\n* excellus bcbs wny:\n\n* dean health plan:\n\nsince we're not members of these insurance companies we're finding it difficult to work with them so we've decided to try and locate members that are currently enrolled and have them call for us we would be more than happy to compensate anyone willing to take a moment and make the call we're simply looking for the dollar amount an insurance company pays out for commercial patients receiving the dna stool test cologuard\n so i attempted the health exchange i was denied for making too much the same goes for my states insurance is there any health insurance tips i have never looked into insurance and all i keep finding is plans around the 600 dollar a month range i can't afford to spend that on minimal coverage so does anyone have a direction to point me in if it helps i am in michigan  i attempted to google around and get some answers already but i lack search terms and google lacks answers \n\nfirst of all i had until this evening believed that the 80/20 rule pertained to each individual policyholder my thought was \"if the insurer does not spend 80% of this policyholder's premiums on medical care this policyholder will receive a refund in the amount of god knows how much\" in searching for what we can expect in refunds for 2015 i happened upon a website that made it sound like the insurance company's overall premium income must go towards at least 80% of health care expenses (covering the entire population of its enrollees) in order for the policyholders to get a refund  \n\nplease tell me this isn't true we are a healthy couple and coughing up over $300 per month on an exchange plan while looking forward to getting some of these unused funds back we can't get a subsidy because my husband's job offers \"affordable\" insurance but charges 600-900 per month (per pay period) if i'm added to the policy we chose an exchange plan in hopes of getting some of that investment back \n\nsecondly is there any way to find an insurance company's budget and discover ahead of time whether or not a refund will be paid to its enrollees\n\ni appreciate any time taken to clarify these questions and i'll be asking my professor during our next online classroom and will post her response here foundations of health insurance (which spawned my whole google project) is a course in medical coding i'm 22 years old and i applied for medical insurance a while back without reading what medi-cal truly was (most because it was free)\n\nmy question is: why was i eligible and why had i received medi-cal i'm definitely not a senior and i do not have any medical issues does income have anything to do with it i made ~$10k in 2013 and was still in school i'm also very single and have no children both of my children have always had double insurance (my ex was military so the insurance wasn't something we paid extra for but tricare isn't great insurance and my daughter had some difficult medical issues that the tricare providers couldn't manage so we always bought health insurance through my work)  my now husband has insurance with a family rate (so i'm covered and my daughter is covered) but his son has never been on his insurance (his ex always included their son on her family insurance so my husband didn't get \"family\" insurance until after we got married and i needed to have coverage)  now it wouldn't be any extra for him to put his son on the insurance policy  i suggested it during he open enrollment period but for some reason his ex (who is a lawyer) was reluctant she hemmed and hawed about needing to \"look into it\" until after the enrollment time was up \n\nbut i can't see any reason why you'd not have the kids double insured (since it's absolutely no extra $$ for anyone) is there a reason not to do this are there potential penalties or strange ethical issues regarding double coverage that i'm not seeing i'm trying to understand why if there is no additional financial cost anyone would opt out of the second insurance coverage i know there are nuances about insurance coverage that i don't see hence my question \n\nthank you what are the key differences  i currently have a private individual plan  i would qualify for a subsidy but even without that they seem cheaper\n\nmy broker tells me my grandfathered private plan is better but why is it better\n\nif i switch to the public exchange plans what will i be giving up so my job just offered me these two plans i totally a noob of all this and was hoping someone could help me out and clear up some of this for me\n\ni'm :\n\nnonsmoker \nsingle\nno kids\n\ni'm just not sure which plan i should go with the ppo is more expensive but seems like it covers more \n\nanyone hi i have a terrible  hmo plan through my employer i'm recently divorced and i'm making $20000 per year which from my understanding is still poverty level would i be eligible to buy private insurance or state insurance having nothing and being asked to pay for everything is quite awful my girlfriend has hiv and has had it for sometime she has been on a program that assists here with her meds and labs---she is afraid that she now makes to much money to qualify for this she has looke dinto health insurance and it seems all have insane rates for this--- she told me today she would need 600 a month for meds and another 4 or 5 hundred for labs can anyone please help a redditor out if a plan does not show co-payments (for dr visits and such) does that mean you will be paying the full amount furthermore will that payment be counted towards your deductible thanks i recently voluntarily left my job and have no insurance i'm in a new part of the country and would like to find insurance as i'm not sure when i will find work that offers it (i just got offered a job but they don't have an insurance plan)\n\nbefore the obvious questions roll in: cobra: $750/month obamacare: $650/month my wife's plan: $550/month part of the reasoning is that my wife and i were both employed for the last few years so we made to much for those programs to be affordable we're not loaded by any means and far from it but all the programs point to our two sources of income in the past which doesn't help considering we only have one source right now i don't want a doctors bill or er visit to put us in debt which is scarier right now than being physically harmed (isn't that scary)\n\nmy question is this: where do i go to get health insurance that would affordable for someone with no income at the moment \n\nhere are my only requirements:\n- to be reasonably covered in the event of an er visit\n- be able to see a local doctor or specialist without having to shop around for one that will take my insurance\n- be covered at the doctors with a copay of $50 or less\n- be affordable to someone who has no money rolling in my current options are ridiculous considering it's insurance and i would be paying rent money to something intangible that will give me nothing more than 'peace of mind' ideally $250 or less would be affordable\n\nhopefully the responses would be helpful to others visiting this thread also  it's not so \"jerry springer\" as the title makes it sound i just found out my boyfriend and i are expecting he is married but the two have been separated for over 2 years she cheated on him did drugs etc they never legally separated though and the divorce process is underway but its slow-going she's still on his policy as she is his wife after all i am uninsured and unemployed i quit my most recent job in the middle of march for very personal reasons i don't know quite how to proceed\n\ni went to planned parenthood today to see if i'm eligible for pcap by the way we live in ny they want my most recent employer to send them a letter verifying my last date of employment there and to fax them all of my pay stubs i find that to be a bit much imo and it takes awhile to reschedule an appointment i'm worried that i'm wasting my time if there is another quicker way i can see a doctor\n\nmy boyfriend tried getting in touch with the woman at his union hall who handles insurance but she's on vacation until next week we're trying to find out if i can be put on his policy at least for prenatal care because it is his child until we speak to them any knowledge of this or advice would be greatly appreciated thank you\n"
